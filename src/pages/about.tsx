    "While the market for online viewing of physical and digital art has existed since the beginning of the internet, image or video-based social media platforms like Instagram, Pinterest and Reddit largely increased its size and reach. While offering a more genuine and immersive experience, physical galleries can be unavailable during disruptive societal events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, they are inaccessible to many for economic, location or scheduling reasons. Our goal was to search for a simple, informative and enjoyable user experience providing a unified alternative or adjunct to physical locations and an improved solution to current digital options. Researching currently available related platforms showed lacks in simplicity, stability, content quality and ease-of-use. It guided us towards a minimalist, high quality image-based UI instead of complex, dynamic and resource-intensive 3D. The applicationâ€™s core functionality consists of searching and viewing artworks in multiple layouts and navigating between them seamlessly.",
